#Some Ansible Adhoc Commnads

Parallelism and Shell Commands
______________________________

Reboot your company server in 12 parallel forks at time. For this, we need to set up SSHagent for connection.
 -> ssh-agent bash 
 -> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa 

To run reboot for all your company servers in a group, 'abc', in 12 parallel forks âˆ’
 -> Ansible abc -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 12

By default, Ansible will run the above Ad-hoc commands form current user account. 
If you want to change this behavior, you will have to pass the username in Ad-hoc commands as follows
 -> Ansible abc -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 12 -u username

File Transfer
_____________

You can use the Ad-hoc commands for doing SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) lots of files in parallel on multiple machines.

Transferring file to many servers/machines
 -> Ansible abc -m copy -a "src = /etc/yum.conf dest = /tmp/yum.conf"

Creating new directory
 -> Ansible abc -m file -a "dest = /path/user1/new mode = 777 owner = user1 group = user1 state = directory"

Deleting whole directory and files
 -> Ansible abc -m file -a "dest = /path/user1/new state = absent"


Managing Packages
_________________

The Ad-hoc commands are available for yum and apt. Following are some Ad-hoc commands using yum.

The following command checks if yum package is installed or not, but does not update it.
 -> Ansible abc -m yum -a "name = demo-tomcat-1 state = present"

The following command check the package is not installed.
 -> Ansible abc -m yum -a "name = demo-tomcat-1 state = absent" 

The following command checks the latest version of package is installed.
 -> Ansible abc -m yum -a "name = demo-tomcat-1 state = latest" 

Gathering Facts
_______________

Facts can be used for implementing conditional statements in playbook. You can find adhoc information of all your facts through the following Ad-hoc command
